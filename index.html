            <p>Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a public holiday in India commemorating the nation's independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when the provisions of the Indian Independence Act, which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly, came into effect.</p>
            <p>This independence day, i.e., 15<sup>th</sup>August 2023, it's been 76 years since our independence from the United Kingdom. We should remember the great contributions of our Great Indian Freedom Fighters like Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad and the list never ends. You must be knowing all these names, right, but do you know who Kamarajar, Kamaladevi and Madam Cama were? These are nobody but the unsung heroes of India whose sacrifices are not remembered in today's date.</p>
            <p>This post is an attempt to make the audience aware about the sacrifices of all the sung, as well as unsung freedom fighters of India who gave up their lives and precious time for the independence of our country; Our Motherland; Our Mother India</p>
